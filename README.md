# Protist Ribosomal Reference database (PR2)
## SSU rRNA gene database

The Protist Ribosomal Reference database (PR2) provides a unique access to eukaryotic small sub-unit (SSU) ribosomal RNA and DNA sequences, with curated taxonomy. The database mainly consists of nuclear-encoded protistan sequences. However, metazoans, land plants, macrosporic fungi and eukaryotic organelles (mitochondrion, plastid and others) are also included because they are useful for the analysis of high-troughput sequencing data sets. Introns and putative chimeric sequences have been also carefully checked. Taxonomic assignation of sequences consists of eight unique taxonomic fields.

The original web site (http://ssu-rrna.org/pr2) does not exist any more.  We are proposing updated version of PR2 as flat files to use for annotating metabarcodes. In 2018, a new web site will be constructed.
