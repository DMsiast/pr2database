## SSU rRNA gene database

The Protist Ribosomal Reference database (PR2) provides a unique access to eukaryotic small sub-unit (SSU) ribosomal RNA and DNA sequences, with curated taxonomy. The database mainly consists of nuclear-encoded protistan sequences. However, metazoans, land plants, macrosporic fungi and eukaryotic organelles (mitochondrion, plastid and others) are also included because they are useful for the analysis of high-troughput sequencing data sets. Introns and putative chimeric sequences have been also carefully checked. Taxonomic assignation of sequences consists of eight unique taxonomic fields.

The original web site (http://ssu-rrna.org/pr2) does not exist any more.  We are proposing updated version of PR2  and provide the data in a variety of file formats to use for annotating metabarcodes.

Plastid 16S rRNA sequences are yet not included into PR2.  These sequences are available from the the PhytoRef database available from [Figshare](https://figshare.com/articles/PhytoREF_a_reference_database_of_the_plastidial_16S_rRNA) or [PhytoRef](http://phytoref.sb-roscoff.fr/).
